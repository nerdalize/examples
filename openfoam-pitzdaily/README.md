# OpenFOAM pitzDaily

This is an example dataset that works with the Nerdalize OpenFOAM docker image. The guide that shows how to use this dataset can be found [here](https://www.nerdalize.com/applications/openfoam).

This example includes the original pitzDaily dataset with the addition of a run file `run.sh`. The file can be used to specify the OpenFOAM commands that need to be executed.

Tip: A dataset can contain multiple run scripts. This will make it easy to run different simulations using the same input dataset. See the [guide](https://www.nerdalize.com/applications/openfoam) to learn how to do this.
